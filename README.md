# PyBer_Analysis
## Purpose
V. Isualize has given us the task of analyzing rideshare data and sort it primarily by the type of city where the rides are given. By disseminating that data into fares by ride and fares by drivers, and compare that to the three types of city we have in our data. Those three types of city are rural, suburban, and urban. We are to present that analysis in a way that can be easily readable line graph. This analysis and data will give V. Isualize a basis for business decisions and set up locations for their ride share app.
## Results
Our analysis has shown that while urban settings bring in a significant amount of fare revenue, the margin does seem to be higher for rides in a rural atmosphere. Suburban ride sharing data sits in the middle of the two although it is closer to urban than rural
